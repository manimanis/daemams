00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.315
We can also divide quantitative data types further.

2
00:00:04.315 --> 00:00:07.930
I assume most of my positive interactions occur with older dogs,

3
00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:09.955
as they've had more time to train.

4
00:00:09.955 --> 00:00:13.539
The age of a dog is a continuous quantitative data type,

5
00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:18.744
while the number of dogs I interact with is a discrete quantitative data type.

6
00:00:18.745 --> 00:00:21.925
In the world, we kind of make all data discrete,

7
00:00:21.925 --> 00:00:26.170
so it can be difficult to see the difference between discrete and continuous.

8
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.120
Continuous data can take on any numeric value including decimal values,

9
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.700
and sometimes even negative numbers.

10
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.490
The age of a dog in this situation is an example of continuous data,

11
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.250
as we could split this variable into smaller and smaller pieces,

12
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.524
and still something exists.

13
00:00:44.524 --> 00:00:47.394
For example, we could talk about age in terms of years,

14
00:00:47.395 --> 00:00:49.465
or months, or days,

15
00:00:49.465 --> 00:00:51.445
or hours, or minutes,

16
00:00:51.445 --> 00:00:55.405
or seconds, and still there are units that are smaller.

17
00:00:55.405 --> 00:00:57.520
This is true of continuous data.

18
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.700
However, discrete data like the number of dogs,

19
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.220
only takes on countable values.
