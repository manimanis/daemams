00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.615
To summarize, we have two main data types,

2
00:00:03.615 --> 00:00:05.880
each with two subgroups.

3
00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.855
Quantitative data can be divided into continuous and discrete.

4
00:00:09.855 --> 00:00:14.039
Categorical can be split into nominal and ordinal.

5
00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:16.679
Identifying data types is important,

6
00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:19.259
as it allows us to understand the types of

7
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.054
analyses that we can perform and the plots that we can build.

8
00:00:23.054 --> 00:00:26.370
Before we dive deeper, check your understanding.

9
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.070
There are quizzes available in the next module to

10
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.800
assure that you've mastered the concepts we've introduced.
