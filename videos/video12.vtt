It is easy as to understand the spread of our data visually.

2
00:00:04.434 --> 00:00:09.779
The most common visual for quantitative data is known as a histogram.

3
00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:15.164
In this video, we will take a look at exactly how histograms are constructed.

4
00:00:15.164 --> 00:00:18.771
In order to understand how histograms are constructed,

5
00:00:18.771 --> 00:00:21.639
consider we have the following data-set.

6
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.399
First, we need to bin our data.

7
00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:29.609
You as the histogram creator ultimately choose how the binning occurs.

8
00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.625
Here, I have chosen our bins as one to four,

9
00:00:33.625 --> 00:00:37.929
five to eight, 9-12 and 13-16.

10
00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:41.698
Because these first four values are between one and four,

11
00:00:41.698 --> 00:00:43.494
they go into the first bin.

12
00:00:43.494 --> 00:00:46.869
These next three values are between five and eight,

13
00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:48.399
so they fall in the next bin,

14
00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:54.039
then these two values fall in this bin and 15 falls into our last bin.

15
00:00:54.039 --> 00:01:00.070
The number of values in each bin determine the height of each histogram bar.

16
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.859
Changing the bins will result in a slightly different visual.

17
00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:08.340
There really isn't a right answer to choosing our bins,

18
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.875
and in most cases software will choose the appropriate bins for us.

19
00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:15.000
But it is something to be aware of.
