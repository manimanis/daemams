00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.989
How should we work with these outliers in practice?

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.565
At the very least,

3
00:00:05.565 --> 00:00:07.385
we should note that they exist.

4
00:00:07.384 --> 00:00:11.939
We need to realize the impact they have on our summary statistics.

5
00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:16.835
In this case, greatly increasing our mean and our standard deviation.

6
00:00:16.835 --> 00:00:20.705
If the outliers are typos or data entry errors,

7
00:00:20.704 --> 00:00:23.104
this is a reason to remove these points.

8
00:00:23.105 --> 00:00:25.205
Or if we know what they should be,

9
00:00:25.204 --> 00:00:28.369
we could change them with the correct values.

10
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.380
In cases like the example above,

11
00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:32.119
we might try to understand,

12
00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.530
what was so different about the outlier when compared to the other individuals?

13
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.770
How did this entrepreneur become so successful?

14
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.665
And why are the earnings so large in comparison?

15
00:00:43.664 --> 00:00:48.729
There is an entire field aimed at this idea called the anomaly detection.

16
00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:53.209
You will notice measures associated with the five number summary, like the minimum,

17
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.060
the maximum and the quartiles one, two,

18
00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.770
three, are more informative when outliers are present.

19
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.549
This example shows that you need to be careful about how we share our results and

20
00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.979
state our conclusions using summary statistics when we have outliers.

21
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:15.625
A single number can be very misleading about what is actually happening in our data.

22
00:01:15.625 --> 00:01:19.420
Some statistics are more misleading than others.

23
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.954
If you are the consumer of information based on data,

24
00:01:22.954 --> 00:01:24.510
which we all are,

25
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.480
it's important to know how to ask

26
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.000
the right questions regarding the statistics around you.
