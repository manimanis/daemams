00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.089
We can divide categorical data types further into

2
00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:06.125
categorical ordinal and categorical nominal.

3
00:00:06.125 --> 00:00:09.870
First, let's look at categorical ordinal data.

4
00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:11.954
Remember those dogs at the coffee shop?

5
00:00:11.955 --> 00:00:15.550
Let's say I give each a rating of how nice it is to me.

6
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.589
Sometimes I shake hands with the dog and we become best friends.

7
00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:22.074
Other times, it pees on my shoe.

8
00:00:22.074 --> 00:00:25.934
I rate these interactions from very positive to very negative.

9
00:00:25.934 --> 00:00:31.000
These ranked categories are known as categorical ordinal data.

10
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.255
Notice, this is different than the breeds,

11
00:00:33.255 --> 00:00:36.120
which are known as categorical nominal data,

12
00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:38.119
and do not have a rank order.
