If you're working with data,

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.109
you can always build a Quick Plot to see the shape.

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.134
Just to apply some context,

4
00:00:09.134 --> 00:00:15.291
some examples of approximately Bell-Shaped data include heights and weights,

5
00:00:15.291 --> 00:00:19.050
standardized test scores, precipitation amounts,

6
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.894
the mean of a distribution,

7
00:00:20.894 --> 00:00:23.669
or errors in manufacturing processes.

8
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.825
Common data that follow Left Skewed Distributions include GPAs,

9
00:00:27.824 --> 00:00:29.804
the age of death,

10
00:00:29.804 --> 00:00:32.329
and asset price changes.

11
00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.199
Common data that follow approximately

12
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.978
Right Skewed Distributions include the amount of drug left in your bloodstream over time,

13
00:00:38.978 --> 00:00:40.575
the distribution of wealth,

14
00:00:40.575 --> 00:00:43.054
and human athletic abilities.

15
00:00:43.054 --> 00:00:44.429
There are links below in

16
00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:48.390
the instructor notes in case you want to learn more about each of these cases.

17
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.000
Though these three, Right Skewed,

18
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.070
Left Skewed and Symmetric,

19
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.185
are the most common distributions,

20
00:00:55.185 --> 00:01:00.480
data in the real world can be messy and it might not follow any of these distributions.

21
00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:04.269
We will talk about this more in the next section.
