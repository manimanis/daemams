    <h3>Exercise 4</h3>
    <p>We want to summarize the number of dogs our friends have into a single number. We will use the measures of
      center for this problem. Ashley has 1 dog, Steve has 1 dog, Jeff has 2 dogs, Kylie has 3 dogs, and Lisa has
      8 dogs.</p>
    <p>There is no best measure of center so we need to try all three to see what makes sense.</p>

    <h3>Exercise 17</h3>
    <p>Which are the correct statements?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For every dataset the mean equals the median, so every dataset is normally distributed</li>
      <li>Normally distributed data must have a mean equal to the median</li>

  <section>
    <h3>Exercise 18</h3>
    <p>In the below image, we have three box-plots. Each box-plot is for a different Iris flower: setosa, versicolor, or virginica. On the y-axis, we are given the sepal length.</p>
    <p>Notice that virginica has an <strong>outlier</strong> towards the bottom of the plot. Therefore, the <strong>minimum</strong> is not given by the bottom line here; rather, it is provided by this point.</p>
    <div class="text-center"><img src="imgs/iris-box-plot.png" alt="Irix Box plot"></div>
    <p>From the image above try to determine which sepal have:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The largest range</li>
      <li>The smallest inter-quartile range</li>
      <li>The median approximately 5</li>
      <li>The third quartile is approximately 6.3</li>
      <li>An approximately symmetric box plot</li>
      <li>The largest sepals on average</li>

    <p>From the statements below, tell which ones are correct.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All Setosa flowers have a shorter sepal length than Versicolor.</li>
      <li>All Virginica flowers have larger sepal length than Setosa flowers</li>
      <li>More than 75% of the Virgnica flowers have a larger sepal length than the largest Setosa flower</li>
      <li>More than 50% of Setosa flowers have larger sepal length the the shortest Versicolor flower</li>
